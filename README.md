# Volunteer Hour Tracking

The purpose of this project is to develop a way to track my volunteer hours for various ongoing projects / entities. This is a personal project, and is not intended for use by others.

If at some point, other might want to use this app, there are things I am not taking into consideration, like data security, password protections, and other administrative tasks.

## Project Goals
I would like to be able to open a deployed app, enter my name and maybe a password? Basic protection? And be able to view several things.

- Log in
- Select Entity
    - Church
    - Columbus Glass Art Center
    - Jazz Arts Group
    - Anything Else? (Code for America would be a great to participate eventually)
- Log Hours
    - current day or recent past?
